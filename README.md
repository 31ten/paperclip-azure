# paperclip-azure

Paperclip-Azure is a [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) storage driver for storing files in a Microsoft Azure Blob.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile after the Paperclip gem:

    gem 'paperclip-optimizer'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

The Azure storage engine has been developed to work as similarly to S3 storage configuration as is possible.  This gem can be configured in a Paperclip initializer as follows:

    Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:storage] = :azure
    Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:url] = ':azure_path_url'
    Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:path] = ":class/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename"
    Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:storage] = :azure
    Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:azure_credentials] = {
        storage_account_name: ENV['AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT'],
        access_key:           ENV['AZURE_ACCESS_KEY'],
        container:            ENV['AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME']
    }

Or, at the level of the model such as in the following example:

    has_attached_file :download, 
                      storage: :azure,
                      azure_credentials: {
                        storage_account_name: ENV['AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT'],
                        access_key:           ENV['AZURE_ACCESS_KEY'],
                        container:            ENV['AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME']
                      }


## Private Blob Access

In the even that are using a Blob that has been configured for Private access, you will need to use the Shared Access Signature functionality of Azure.  This functionality has been baked in to the `Attachment#expiring_url` method. Simply specify a time and a style and you will get a proper URL as follows:

  object.attachment.expiring_url(30.minutes.since, :thumb)
